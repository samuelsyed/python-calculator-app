# Python Calculator App

A simple command-line calculator built with Python. Supports basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
The way this calculator works is that it first prompts you for a number and then asks you to choose the listed operation and calculates the result. 
After displaying the result, it prompts you if you want to carry on or not ('y' or 'n') - if you decide to carry on it'll use your previous result and continue the calculation,
otherwise, if you say 'n' then it'll wipe the memory and start again!
